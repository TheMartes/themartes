## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Matej](https://x.com/TheMartes_)!

This github doesn't necessarily represents my activity as developer as I'm mostly working on self-hosted git hostings.

Open-Source is kinda cool, mostly not, but exceptions do exists. See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/themartes/dotfiles) to learn more.
